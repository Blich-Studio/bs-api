# 🔗 README.md GitHub Links - Fix Report

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - All wiki links now work on GitHub

---

## 📋 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Wiki links in README.md were using relative paths like `wiki/Quick-Start.md` which **don't work on GitHub Wiki pages**.

### Why?

- ✅ On GitHub **repo README** (main branch): `wiki/Quick-Start.md` works fine
- ❌ On GitHub **Wiki pages**: Relative paths fail because wiki pages expect different paths

---

## 🔧 Solution Applied

**Changed all wiki links from relative paths to absolute GitHub URLs:**

### Old Format (Broken on Wiki):

```markdown
[Quick Start](wiki/Quick-Start.md)
```

### New Format (Works Everywhere):

```markdown
[Quick Start](https://github.com/Blich-Studio/bs-api/wiki/Quick-Start)
```

## 📌 Note

The same approach could be applied to other markdown files if they reference wiki pages:

- `DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Still uses relative paths (works in repo)
- `WIKI_INDEX.md` - Still uses relative paths (works in repo)

These are internal documentation files and work fine locally, but if you want them to work universally too, they can be updated similarly.

---

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

All README links to wiki pages now work on GitHub, both from the repo README and from within the GitHub Wiki pages themselves.

**Ready to commit and deploy! 🎉**
